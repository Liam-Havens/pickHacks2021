# PickHacks Project Submission

This repo was submitted for Missouri S&T University's PickHacks Hackathon (April 2021).

Our project is a web-based application aimed at bridging the gap between the gaming and music communities. The app serves as a platform for gamers to share and link music playlists to specific video games. Users can create accounts, upload their own plalists, and view and access other users' playlists. Users are also able to search for playlists by videogame tag.

Run the program "npm start" inside both the client and server directories.
